#Linear Regression
#takes dependent variable and uses independent variables to predict dependent variable
#create model that is good at yielding what the true results would be
#run linear regression: get different coefficients for each independent variable (aka weights)

#model
#R:     
#try to keep data values independent of each other
#covert percentages
#p value: if p value under 0.05, you can be more confident in the variable's coefficient

#using the model
#use stats and multiply by coefficents
#or predict
